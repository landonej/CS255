The DriverPass project was to design a system that allowed new drivers to gain knowledge and pass their dmv tests. It also allows for drivers and admins to update information. They wanted to build a web based system to allow all types of browsers and OS’s.

What I did well was my use case and my activity diagrams. I believe I showed all the required items and included validation checking.

I would improve my assumptions and limitations. I feel like  I could do this if I did more researching on costs of the system and what the owner could afford.

I interpreted the users’ needs into the requirements of the design. Its important to consider the need because the system will resolve around the user. You don’t want to create the system then show the owner and it didn’t consider any of the user needs and then you will have to revisit the system. 

When approaching designing software, you want to start with gathering all applicable information from the owner and from their sift through and pick out parts that are relevant to the design. Once you have that its easy to get the requirements and start designing diagram.
